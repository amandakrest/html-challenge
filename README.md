# html-challenge
There are two jupyter notebook files, one for each part of the challenge and labled as such.
Additionally there is a csv file correlated with part 2.

I worked with a tutor on part two of this challenge.

My computer was having issues with running splinter on its own so selenium was used to help chromedriver work.
